Collection of scripts used for analysis in:

Turner, JA, Babcock, RC, Kendrick, GA, Hovey, RK. How does spatial resolution affect model performance? A case for ensemble approaches for marine benthic mesophotic communities. J Biogeogr. 2019; 46: 1249â€“ 1259. https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13581


**DATA ACCESSIBILITY**:
All topographic GIS layers and the ensemble model outputs are archived as raster grids on the Ningaloo Outlook Project website (https://research.csiro.au/ningaloo/outlook/research-outputs/) and on the Dryad data repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nh07v50). For some datasets an embargo period may apply.
